There may be issues regarding board resetting using other browsers such as Chrome, so using FireFox is suggested.

Instructions on how to play the tour, as well as background information are stated in the information section to the left and right of the chessboard; to start the tour, click on a square to select the starting position for the Knight.

After you have selected a starting position, you can use the buttons found beneath the chessboard to go through the tour.
There are buttons to move the knight to the next step, move the knight back a step, and a button to completely finish the tour.
Note the finish tour button can be used partway through a tour.

If you wish to change the size of the board, change the value in the input field below the board to a value from 1-12 depending on the size of board you want, then click the "Reset" button to make the changes. The "Reset" button can also be used to reset the current board without changing the size of the board.
